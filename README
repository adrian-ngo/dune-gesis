DUNE-GESIS
==========

This is version 1.0.1-rc1 of the DUNE-GESIS module.

GESIS (GEoStatistical Inversion based on Stationary problems) 
is a collection of applications for the solution of 
(1) the steady-state groundwater flow problem,
(2) the steady-state groundwater solute transport,
(3) the large-scale inverse problem 
    (estimating the hydraulic conductivity of a confined aquifer 
    from measurements of the hydraulic head or the temporal moments 
    of a tracer concentration) 
    using the quasi-linear geostatistical approach (QLGA).


The following six applications can be built:

1. gesis2dDG: solves (1)+(2)+(3) on a structured 2-D mesh with rectangular elements 
              (using the DUNE-YASP grid)

2. gesis3dDG: solves (1)+(2)+(3) on a structured 3-D mesh with rectangular elements 
              (using the DUNE-YASP grid)

3. gesisUG2dDG: solves (1) on a structured 2-D mesh with rectangular elements,
                solves (2) on a locally refined 2-D mesh with non-conforming refinement of rectangular elements
                (using the UG grid, sequential version only)

4. gesisALU3dDG: solves (1) on a structured 3-D mesh with rectangular elements,
                 solves (2) on a locally refined 3-D mesh with non-conforming refinement of rectangular elements
                 (using the dune-alugrid module, parallelized with dynamic load-balancind)

5. gesis2dFEM: solves (1)+(2)+(3) on a structured 2-D mesh with rectangular elements 
              (using the DUNE-YASP grid)

6. gesis3dFEM: solves (1)+(2)+(3) on a structured 3-D mesh with rectangular elements 
              (using the DUNE-YASP grid)

Applications 1-4 are based on the cell-centered finite volume and the discontinuous Galerkin schemes (CCFV/DG),
applications 5-6 are based on the standard Galerkin FEM method and the streamline diffusion method (FEM/SDFEM).

Dependencies
------------

DUNE-GESIS depends on the following software packages:

* The DUNE core modules, version 2.3.1.
* The DUNE module dune-typetree, version 2.3.1.
* The DUNE module dune-pdelab, version 2.0.0.
* DUNE-GESIS uses lots and lots of templates, so you need a decent C++ compiler.
  C++11 support is required. 
  It is tested for gcc 4.8.2, gcc 4.8.3 and clang 3.4.

For a full explanation of the DUNE installation process please read
the installation notes [2] or the build system HOWTO [3].

Furthermore, the following external libraries are required.

* The Boost PropertyTree (version 1.47.0 or higher) 
  See http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_47_0/doc/html/property_tree.html.

* The FFTW library (version 3.3.2 or higher).
  See http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/release/obtain5.html.

* The HDF5 library (version 1.8.13 or higher).
  See http://www.fftw.org/download.html.
