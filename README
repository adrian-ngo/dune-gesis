DUNE-GESIS
==========

This is version 1.0.1-rc1 of the DUNE-GESIS module.

GESIS (GEoStatistical Inversion based on Stationary problems) 
is a collection of applications for the solution of 
(1) the steady-state groundwater flow problem,
(2) the steady-state groundwater solute transport,
(3) the large-scale inverse problem 
    (estimating the hydraulic conductivity of a confined aquifer 
    from measurements of the hydraulic head or the temporal moments 
    of a tracer concentration) 
    using the quasi-linear geostatistical approach (QLGA).


The following six applications can be built:

1. gesis2dDG: solves (1)+(2)+(3) on a structured 2-D mesh with rectangular elements 
              (using the DUNE-YASP grid)

2. gesis3dDG: solves (1)+(2)+(3) on a structured 3-D mesh with rectangular elements 
              (using the DUNE-YASP grid)

3. gesisUG2dDG: solves (1) on a structured 2-D mesh with rectangular elements,
                solves (2) on a locally refined 2-D mesh with non-conforming refinement of rectangular elements
                (using the UG grid, sequential version only)

4. gesisALU3dDG: solves (1) on a structured 3-D mesh with rectangular elements,
                 solves (2) on a locally refined 3-D mesh with non-conforming refinement of rectangular elements
                 (using the dune-alugrid module, parallelized with dynamic load-balancind)

5. gesis2dFEM: solves (1)+(2)+(3) on a structured 2-D mesh with rectangular elements 
              (using the DUNE-YASP grid)

6. gesis3dFEM: solves (1)+(2)+(3) on a structured 3-D mesh with rectangular elements 
              (using the DUNE-YASP grid)

Applications 1-4 are based on the cell-centered finite volume and the discontinuous Galerkin schemes (CCFV/DG),
applications 5-6 are based on the standard Galerkin FEM method and the streamline diffusion method (FEM/SDFEM).

Dependencies
------------

TypeTree depends on the following software packages:

* The dune-common library from DUNE, version 2.3.x. The dependency is actually very
  weak, and you can easily use the library standalone by replacing the few convenience
  components reused from dune-common (and by replacing the build system, of course).

* TypeTree uses lots and lots of templates, so you need a decent C++ compiler. This
  initial release should still compile with GCC 4.2, but we plan to bump up the
  requirements to the level of C++11 support provided by GCC 4.4 or 4.5 (not decided
  yet). Even now, compile times are greatly reduced if the compiler supports the new
  C++11 standard (GCC 4.3 and newer). PDELab is not regularly tested with ICC (it should
  work with ICC 13.x), but we also support the clang compiler (3.1+).

For a full explanation of the DUNE installation process please read
the installation notes [2] or the build system HOWTO [3].
